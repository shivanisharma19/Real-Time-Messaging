## UI/UX

The design is kept generic for the better user experience. The user land on the homepage and once user clicks on any contact from the contact list given on the left panel, chat window appears for that contact like other popular web messaging applications. The choice of colors and appearance reflects the combination of light and dark mode. 
Bit and pieces of design are inspired from various web messaging application like Web WhatsApp, Slack etc.
